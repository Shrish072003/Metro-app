An increasing number of customers are showing interest in where their food comes from and are demanding healthier and sustainable options when they eat out. By carefully picking the products you present on your menu, you can create a positive and long-lasting impact on the environment and the health of your customers.

                            The availability of our food is increasingly threatened by climate change and our experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the vulnerability of some supply chains. Sustainable products can provide environmental, social or economic benefits while protecting health and environment over their whole life cycle. Sustainable produced meat and dairy does of course still emit carbon (via methane) but the natural carbon cycle is kept very nearly in balance. Therefore, sustainable products are at the core of transforming the world’s challenges around sustainable consumption and production.

                    <p>
                        To be more connected with your customers and suppliers while building trust and credibility in your relationship with them, ask yourself if your products are responsibly sourced and sustainable. Our comprehensive guide to sustainable products will help you to find information more easily. Take a closer look at your supply chain and get engaged with your suppliers on sustainability topics. Schemes that guarantee a fair price of the product and fair treatment of workers, the origin and way of production or the compostability of packaging will provide you with more information and orientation on the sustainability aspects of your products. Don’t forget to track your progress and talk about successful steps toward becoming a sustainable restaurant.
