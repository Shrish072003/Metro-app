                                                        The arrival of new season produce generates a real excitement and
                                                        expectation of tastes to come. You can demonstrate how in touch
                                                        you are with your food sources by updating your menu according
                                                        to the season. This includes several advantages. It is a good
                                                        opportunity to market your business and attract new customers by
                                                        bringing in fresh tastes. Seasonal foods can also be cheaper, and
                                                        usually taste better. New season produce is fresher due to reduced time in storage and transport
                                                        and you can actively support your local growers by sourcing from them in season.

                                                        Animal welfare means that fewer animals occupy a given space which means there is less need for antibiotics and medicines whose residues can end up in food. This has a positive impact on the health of consumers. At the same time, it raises awareness among employees and affects how they treat animals.

A robust traceability system means that fish doesn’t come from illegal fishing, the exact catching area is known and the way it is produced is clear. If sustainability guidelines are followed, for both wild caught and farmed fish, the fishermen work in a safe environment and are compensated adequately. The environment is carefully managed and the local communities are supported.
